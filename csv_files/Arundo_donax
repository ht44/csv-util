I\'m 6-foot-4, and I was standing and looking up as I took this photo. The point of this series is that Arundo donax has such a distinct appearance in satellite photos that people who cannot even get outdoors can help locate patches of this invasive exotic. It takes no sophisticated electronic equipment to interpret this imagery. It just takes people with eyesight, a computer, and a Web connection. Under the right conditions, chinaberries can also be recognized from satellite imagery. (In wintertime photos at the right resolution, the golden hue of their berries can be picked out.) I believe I\'ve also identified large patches of elephant ears this way. When they\'re blooming, I think Ligustrum lucidum can also be picked outâ€”in some satellite views, I\'ve seen dark green areas with smudges of white scattered among them. Imagine the value this would have for people working on large preservesâ€”they could be clued in to areas where they\'re likely to find specific species, areas they might not have even tried to reach had someone poring over satellite images not known to point it out to them."
