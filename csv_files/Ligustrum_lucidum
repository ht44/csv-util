This specimen is typical of many found hereâ€”on the border line between what can easily be handled with a hand saw and what would require chain saws to make real progress. Poison ivy is also present, but generally not the density that would require its removal before work could begin. One thing that is a factor: This low-lying land is highly susceptible to erosion, and would be more so with these trees removed. Reestablishing plants with a dense network of rootsâ€”for example, by bolstering the current population of roughleaf dogwoodâ€”and perhaps other protective measures is an essential part of any significant removal action."

Mature trees should be easy to spot because of their corky bark, but it would be too easy for people to indiscriminately remove every plant with glossy leaves.

Thus, the commonly used approach of having volunteers with handsaws reduce the trees to breast height and contractors with chainsaws and herbicide follow soon after to cut the stumps flush with the ground probably would work here. One concern: Between the trail and the creek in this areas are many more ligustrum of this size, surrounded by thick, generally desirable and native, brush. We\'ll need a carefully considered plan carried out by skillful sawyers to attack those. It might be best to work when the creek is down, as we might find easier access to those from creekside."

Few, if any, of the ligustrum are too large to remove with a weed wrench.
