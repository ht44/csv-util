The most recently completed parts of these highways have thousands of these plants growing in the rights of ways of the highways, even though in most areas the plants are noticeably not visible in any of the cultivated or undisturbed areas near the roadways.  The exceptions are a few places where there is an abundance of this plant on elevated areas near the highways.  In some places, a few plants are beginning to show up downhill or downstream in cultivated areas such as ranchland which otherwise do not have these plants.  The damage at this time, the first growing season for this plant after the toll roads were completed, is extreme.  Were the seeds introduced by road equipment, or were these thousands of invaders all carried here by wind and able to take advantage of the disturbed soils?  Or were they brought in in road fill?"
