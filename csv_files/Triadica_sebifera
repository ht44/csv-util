Basal stem treated all four trees with a 25% solution of Garlon 4 with diesel, but believe due to large diameter will need to re-treat larger tree. In attempt to leave dead standing snag (very little nesting habitat at Padre Island), plan to girdle tree with chainsaw with a 3"" deep cut all the way around trunk, as close to ground as possible, then spray within cut area with a 50% solution of Garlon 4 with diesel.
