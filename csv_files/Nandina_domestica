This specimen is one of 36 I photographed along this loop. As I mentioned earlier, this area is an open woodland largely free of poison ivy. A group of grade-schoolers could make a significant contribution, if only by cutting off the clusters of berries and starting them on their way to Hornsby Bend.  A group of middle schoolers could follow with spading forks to undermine and loosen the root systems and medium or even small weed wrenchs to lift the plant from the loosened soil.

There is a second loop on this half of the bend, but I did not survey it.
