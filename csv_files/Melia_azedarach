On east side of Menelee, just south of where NW 17th meets it. Fairly steep slope on this side of road along Menelee, apparently no structures on it, but on the flat area above; in this one spot there is an adult (cottonwood?) tree and some bushes and brush. Among them clumps of young Chinaberry trees growing up from what I suppose to be 2 or 3 roots."

I say polygon because there is more than one; more like a smallish group of youngish Chinaberry trees growing up along slope of drainage creek, where it crosses under 67, just E of intersection with 144 going south. Area appears to be have more dense vegetation than in hybrid map. Next observation is chinaberry on banks of creek on N side of 67."
